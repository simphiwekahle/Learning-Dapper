Repository Architecture

Go to Data.Layer ~ Project
~~ Add 'Models' folder
~~~ Add 'Domain' folder
~~~~ Add 'Table.cs' class
	*verify that your variables are similar to those in your SSMS database table.

~~ Add 'Repository' folder
~~~ Add 'interface' for TableRepository (add 'I' as prefix)
~~~ Add 'class' for TableRepository

Go to UI.MVC Project
~ Go to 'Program.cs'
~~ // Add services to the container.
	builder.Services.AddTransient<ITableRepository, TableRepository>();

*Check the repository and populate the interface and class accordingly
